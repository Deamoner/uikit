uikit is inspired by HTML/CSS. Therefore, many properties are similar with minor syntactical difference.

## No more CSS files

In uikit classes can be defined directly in the file. Styles should not be seperated from their usage.
The use of inline styles is recommended and supported through the typescript type system.
